Some instructions on the project and our expectations. The date of submission of the project will be announced later but likely a few days after the end-semester exam.

1. Identify at least two random variables from your dataset that you propose to study. For the specific topic that you chose, identify at least two random variables that you would like to study.

2. Fit distributions for your random variables (optional). In certain cases, you may be able to fit a known distribution like a Gaussian, exponential, etc. to the empirically observed normalized histogram of the random variable over the population. You could try fitting this using maximum likelihood estimation, or get a sense of how good the fit is use a goodness-of-fit test.

3. Clearly formulate at least one hypothesis and test it. You are expected to make at least one clear hypothesis about your system. Once you identify your hypothesis, you are expected to formulate a clear null and alternative hypothesis level, choose a significance level (typically 5% or 1%) and test the hypothesis using the tools taught in the class. Conclude by summarizing what this means for your particular system. Note that this is a purely data driven hypothesis - you are not expected to know the detailed physics of the system.

4. Analyze the relationship between the two variables. Since you have at least two random variables for your system, you can expect that they are related in some way. This means performing a correlation analysis between your random variables, performing regression, getting point and interval estimates for your regression curves, formulating and testing suitable hypotheses about such a dependence, etc.

5. Note that the above points are the baseline which all groups are expected to do at the very least. Just doing this will not guarantee full marks.

6. Visualize your data properly. Throughout the project, you are expected to clearly visualize the data using the various tools taught in class so that you get a deeper understanding of your problem.

7. Summarize your results in a jupyter notebook. You are expected to systematically record your observations and summarize your findings about your topic of interest. Your notebook should reflect the various stages of data analysis outlined above. The uploaded notebook on moodle should be fully rendered and not require us to run the code and do not use any interactive widgets. You can have an optional section with widgets but that should not be central to your analysis.

8. You should upload the fully rendered notebook without us needing to run the cells. Also upload your data if possible and definitely share links and details on how you obtained this data in your notebook.

9. First cell of your notebook should contain the following information:
    Title
    Team Number (ref https://moodle.iitb.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=44459#p56381)
    Team members with their roll numbers
    Link to the video
    Links and information on the dataset used

10. Make a small video to broadcast your findings. An integral part of doing good science is learning the ability to communicate it well too. Each team will be required to make one video - 5 to 7 minutes in duration (no longer than 7 minutes please) - that summarizes your topic, explains its relevance and/or your particular interest in that topic, outline the various studies you have done on that data, and clearly state the various conclusions that you have reached based on your analysis. Each team member is required to present at various points in the video. You should use the notebook itself for your presentation and you can walk through the notebook, so take some effort to make a clean notebook.

Important note, due to file size restrictions on moodle, you will need to upload the video on google drive or onedrive or some other place to share it with us. Only one member of your team needs to do this. A google form will be shared where you can provide a link to this. Also put the link on your notebook. Once you upload the video, you should double-check the permissions and try downloading from a different account as we may not be able to reach out to you in case we are not able to access it. Given the timeline we have no time to email you etc. so if we cannot see the video you will loose out the marks for the presentation. The video should render correctly on Google Chrome or Firefox.

No duplicate submissions from the same team for notebooks or for the presentation video link. You may all assemble and do it together or however you like but only two submissions per team from one of the member’s accounts: one for notebook on Moodle and one for presentation link on shared google form.

Please note that we expect that groups with more people will do more work than smaller groups. Everyone is expected to participate. In your notebook, you should also have a short section of who did what work in your group.

Avoid taking data from any existing project online. Use datasets from data.gov.in. Once you have found your dataset and have formed an idea of what you want to do, search online to ensure that nobody has already done exactly what you have planned. Note that after the submission, TAs will search online for similar projects and also compare your notebook against previous batches' submissions.

Do not copy the project from elsewhere, a severe penalty will be enforced if you do this. Also avoid using ChatGPT etc. for doing the analysis. You can of course see documentation, search, stackoverflow etc. but try to write the code by yourselves.

If the majority of a team feels that some of the team mates did not do any work, you can send me one email (with CC to the majority of other team mates) to disbar the absent team mates and those students will get a penalty including the possibility of getting zero marks for the particular student.

The due date is final, and we will not be able to extend it anymore, this time. You may set an internal deadline two days before the actual deadline and work towards it.

Reminder: please add the link to the video in your notebook when one of you uploads it and please fill up the form when shared. Please double check the video link so we are able to download it. Also ensure your uploaded notebook is fully rendered.

As regards the assessment of the project, the rough marking will be as below:

Initial proposal quality/clarity: 1 mark Notebook quality (clarity of material): 3 marks Analysis quality and quantity: 4 marks Presentation video quality/clarity: 2 mark

Too long a video (> 7 mins) will entail a penalty.

We hope that you make an effort to work well with your team members. The important thing is to have fun doing the project. It is fine if you don’t have a great, exciting conclusion from your project. What matters more to us is that you make a genuine effort and give it your best shot. We hope you will enjoy doing these projects. All the best!
